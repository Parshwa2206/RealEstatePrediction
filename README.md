# RealEstatePrediction
It is a real life Data Science project that focuses on building a Machine Learning model for property price prediction on the basis of various features such as size, square feet, bedroom, location, etc.
In this project we have covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, model building, Grid Search CV for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation etc.
We have built a website for Real Estate Prediction using PHP , HTML, CSS, J Query & JavaScript which have features mentioned earlier.
Technology and tools wise this project covers:
1) Python 2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning 3) Matplotlib for data visualization 4) Sklearn for model building 5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and PyCharm as IDE 6) Python flask for http server 7) PHP/HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
